# OnDiet

Who will this app help?
People who would like to take care of their weight.

Well, Why am I doing this?
Because I am obese and selfish. And they say "The perfect couple does not exist". 

I spent my whole life thinking "the world is not prepared for people who need to be on diet", "the world is not prepared for people who can't eat some things made by flour or sugar". All of those thought were lies created by my self.
Always there is an option. Left the diet isn't an option.
If the ready-to-go buffet makes only fat-rich food, I am sorry darling, but you will must to make you own food.

How I can help pleople ?
Making a self control tool.

-Fasting Weight.
-Water intake per day.
-The pills the doctor told you to take every day.
